# BCS-OUK Gen AI Seminar — Project Repository

This repository contains course work and practical exercises for the BCS-OUK Generative AI Seminar. It holds Jac and Python & Jac experiments, projects and assignment solutions made while learning generative models and integrating them with local tooling.
The seminar focuses on building practical applications using Jac and popular LLM backends. The code in this repo demonstrates: building simple CLI apps with Jac, integrating LLMs for hint generation and interactive experiences, and testing LLM APIs.

The **LLM Abstraction** processes the message, potentially using:\n    *   **RAG:** If the chat type is RAG-related, the RAG engine retrieves relevant information from the document store.\n    *   **Web Search Integration:** If appropriate, the system performs a web search using **MCP** and incorporates the results.\n5.  The **LLM Abstraction** generates a response, taking into account the chat history, RAG results, and web search results.\n6.  The system sends the response back to the user.\n7.  **Session Management** updates the chat history with the new message and response.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis intelligent chat system utilizes a modular architecture and powerful technologies like LLMs and RAG to provide a rich and context-aware conversational experience. The use of MCP allows for easy extension and integration of new tools and services.\n\n\n## Chapters\n\n### Chapter 1: LLM Abstraction\n\n# LLM Abstraction\n\n## High-Level Explanation\n\nThis chapter explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the project.
